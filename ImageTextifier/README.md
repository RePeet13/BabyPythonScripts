# Image Textifier
This utility takes in an image and a corpus of text, and renders the image through only the color of the text. If the text is not long enough to cover the whole image, it is wrapped.

## Usage
Pass in an image and textify it!
```
python ImageTextifier.py -i files/src.png -t files/text_corpus.txt
```
